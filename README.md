# The-Weather-Transformer
This repository contains (cleaned-up) source code of Alerskans et. al, (2022).

It contains a Transformer NN for post-processing numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast data using observational data. The code is based on the minGPT model implementation: https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT.
